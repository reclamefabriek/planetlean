Northrop came up with a design that Sakichi Toyoda was able to reverse engineer and tweak. The famous Model G loom that Sakichi perfected in 1924 was an original design, but there were influences from elsewhere.<br/>Charles Francis, the first American employee of Toyota starting in 1906, was an expert in precision machining.

It is comprised of four values and 12 principles that have much in common with lean thinking. The term “agile” itself was borrowed from the failed effort of American manufacturers to develop Agile Manufacturing as their own answer to lean production at the Iacocca Institute at Lehigh University starting in 1991.<br/>Parallel to the agile movement, Jeff Sutherland introduced Scrum, inspired by the 1995 HBR article by Japanese management academician Ikujiro Nonoka called “The Knowledge Creating Company.” Scrum and numerous variations of “lean kanban” are often seen as specific agile software development practices."}
